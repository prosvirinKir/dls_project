## Image style transfering 

This is a bot that can change the style of the input image.
To do this, you need to upload *two* photos:
1. The first - you want to change the style of,
2. The second - in which style everything will be.

Write /start to get started and /help to display help.

The bot returns the final image in about a minute, so you have to wait a bit for the magic to happen.
Output image size is 200\*200.

**Note.** For better final quality, upload the second photo in 200\*200 resolution.

The output should look something like this:
